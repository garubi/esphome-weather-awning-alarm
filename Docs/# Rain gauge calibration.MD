# Rain gauge calibration

You do need to calibrate it by measuring the surface collection area, and putting in a controlled amount of water from a syringe, etc. 
while counting the pulses. I measured mine at 5cm x 11cm, and 6 pulses per 10mL => 10/6 = 1.67mL per pulse.

1mm rain = 0.1*5*11cm = 5.5 mL
1" rain = 2.54*5*11cm = 139.70 mL

@ 6 pulses per 10mL => 10/6 = 1.67mL per pulse

pulses / mm = 5.5 / (10/6) = 3.3
pulses / in = 139.7/(10/6) = 83.82

mm / pulse = 0.30303
in / pulse = 0.01193

or 83.82 pulses per inch of rain - reasonably good resolution for such an inexpensive instrument. 
Best to measure yours independently, though, just in case there's more than one variant.

Also, it's important that this type of rain gauge be mounted perfectly level, clear of any trees, buildings etc. 
and close to 5ft / 1.5m height to be in agreement with usual meteorological standards.
